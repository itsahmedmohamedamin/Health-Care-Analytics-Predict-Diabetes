# Health-Care-Analytics-Predict-Diabetes

## Below is a comprehensive analysis for patients with diabetes, accompanied by a machine learning model designed to predict the presence of diabetes and determine its severity.

1- **Histogram representation for each factor influencing the occurrence and severity of diabetes**

## Conclusions from the above graph:
1- **The majority of diabetes patients have a GlycoHemoglobin level ranging between 5 and 6.5.**

2- **The arm circumference of most diabetes patients falls between 13 and 46 centimeters.**

3- **The sagittal abdominal diameter in most diabetes patients is 22 centimeters, while in others, it remains within the normal range.**

4- **The grip strength of the majority of diabetes patients is measured at 22, with the remainder exhibiting grip strength within the normal range.**

5- **Family income does not influence the incidence of diabetes.**

2- **Scater Plot of GlycoHemoglobin vs Diabetes & Scatter Plot of GlycoHemoglobin vs GlycoHemoglobin**

## Conclusions from the above graph:
1- **Individuals with a GlycoHemoglobin level ranging from 3 to 6 are considered to not have diabetes. Those with an GlycoHemoglobin level between 6 and 7 are classified as having diabetes at Level 1, while individuals with an GlycoHemoglobin level between 7 and 18 are categorized as having Level 2 diabetes.**

2- **Individuals with elevated levels of GlycoHemoglobin level typically present with normal or near-normal sagittal abdominal dimensions. The peak incidence of sagittal abdominal measurement occurs in individuals with HbA1c levels between 4 and 8.**

3- **Bar Chart between Breast Fet and Diabetes**

**Most people has Breast Fet 2 and most of them doesn't have diabetes**
