2- **The arm circumference of most diabetes patients falls between 13 and 46 centimeters.**

3- **The sagittal abdominal diameter in most diabetes patients is 22 centimeters, while in others, it remains within the normal range.**

4- **The grip strength of the majority of diabetes patients is measured at 22, with the remainder exhibiting grip strength within the normal range.**

5- **Family income does not influence the incidence of diabetes.**
